Introduction

In this project, we will be testing PHPTRAVELS using Selenium IDE to record and create user tests. We will then automate these tests using Selenium WebDriver.
Objectives

    To create user tests for the PHPTRAVELS using Selenium IDE (Check test scenarios document).
    To automate the user tests using Selenium WebDriver.
    To ensure the application functions as intended by performing automated tests.

Methodology

    Setting up the PHPTRAVELS demo account form link.
    Recording user tests: We will use Selenium IDE to record user tests .
    Writing test scripts: We will convert the recorded user tests into Python test scripts using Selenium WebDriver. Test will be ran for different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, IE, Safari)
    Test automation: We will automate the test scripts using Selenium WebDriver to perform automated testing of PHPTRAVELS.
    Identifying issues: We will analyze the results of the automated tests to identify any bugs or issues PHPTRAVELS.
